      <h1>About Rinaya</h1>
      <p>
        At its core, relationship coaching is about understanding human emotions, attachment,
        communication, conflict, and behavior all of which require more than a weekend certification.<br>
        They require a foundation in psychology.

            <p>
              Every member of our team has a background in psychology.<br>
              We hold Master's in Clinical Psychology, and several members of our team are licensed psychologists,
              registered with the Order of Psychologists in Lebanon, and operate under a strict ethical code.

            <p>
              We're trained to recognize and work with the underlying
              psychological patterns that shape relationships; like emotional
              regulation, attachment wounds, sexuality, intimacy blocks and more.

              Our sessions aren't based on one-size-fits-all frameworks.
              We tailor our coaching to meet people where they are,
              and are informed by years of psychological education
              and real-world practice.

          <div class="faqContent">
            <p>
              If a situation goes beyond coaching and enters the realm of therapy,
              we know how to spot it and when to refer out. We don't overstep.
              We stay in our lane, and we act with integrity.

              We use coaching techniques supported by psychological theory.
              Our work is rooted in depth, insight, and real human development.

          <div class="faqContent">
            <p>
              We believe coaching is a powerful space for growth, but only when
              practiced with care, ethics, and the right foundation. That's why
              our team is built by professionals who understand the mind,
              not just the method.
